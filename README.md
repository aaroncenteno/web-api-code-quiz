# web-api-code-quiz

## Description

This weeks project was exceptionally challenging. The task was to create a quiz with numerous functions using JavaScript. The quiz opens with a start page and when the button is clicked the quiz begins and the time begins going down from 50 seconds. The player is presented with a question and an option of 4 answers to that question. If the player answers correctly they are notified and moved onto the next question. However, if the player answers incorrectly then they are penalized with a reduction of 2 points and loss of 10 seconds of time. The player is notified whether they answered correctly or incorrectly at the bottom of the page. At the end of the quiz the player is shown their score and prompted to enter their initials to store their score in the local storage. Once the submit button is clicked they are taken to the high score list. On this page the player is then able to return to the opening page of the quiz and try again if they so desire.

### What I Learned

JavaScript has been rather hard for me to wrap my head around. It took a lot of videos and reading just for me to get a better understanding of it. One thing I learned was how critical a punctuation point can be. At one point during this assignment I mistakenly added a comma to an area, that then prompted my displayQuestion function to return as undefined. Dev tools showed me to the line where the code was undefined but it could not show me why or where the root of the problem was. After two hours of scanning my code over and over I finally found the culprit to be a comma. Once removed the code began to function as intended. 

Due to JavaScript also being harder to understand than CSS and HTML I found myslef re-typing code over and over and saying in my head what its function was so that I could understand it and grasp. Even going as far as to begin retyping the code on a blank file. I feel stronger in it than I did before, but there is still a quite a bit to go.
